[Link to NumEval](https://sites.google.com/view/numeval/numeval)

This task consists of two subtasks:

## Subtask 1: 

Focused on numerical reasoning, models are required to compute the correct number to fill the blank in a news headline. The data sets consists of 4 columns - news, masked headline, calculation and answer. 

### One Step: 

* DistilRoBERTa: sub1_roberta.ipynb - 79.8% accuracy
* T5-base by Michal Pleban: code/sub1_michau.ipynb - 87.7% accuracy
* T5 by Caleb Zearing: code/sub1_cz.ipynb - 87.8% accuracy
* LaMini-Flan-T5-783M: code/sub1_lamini.ipynb - 88.6% accuracy

### Two Steps: 
Step 1: news & masked headlines as inputs and calculations as outputs.
Step 2: calculations as inputs and answers (numbers) as outputs. 

* T5-base by Michal Pleban: code/sub1_michau_2steps.ipynb - 87.9% accuracy
* T5 by Caleb Zearing: code/sub1_cz_2steps.ipynb - 88.1% accuracy
* LaMini-Flan-T5-783M: code/sub1_lamini_2steps_final.ipynb - **90.2%** accuracy

- outputs/Lamini28.xlsx - calculation methods generated by LaMini-Flan-T5-783M 2 steps
- outputs/predictions.txt - final answers by LaMini-Flan-T5-783M 2 steps

## Subtask 2: 

Models are required to generate an entire headline based on the provided news. 

* T5-base by Michal Pleban: sub2_michal.ipynb (outputs/sub2_michal.xlsx: headlines generated)
* T5 by Caleb Zearing: sub2_cz.ipynb (outputs/sub2_cz.xlsx: headlines generated)
